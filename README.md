# ExiledPatcher
This, was orginally made for Joker (The creator of EXILED). But was then changed for everyone, this tool allows you to completly update exiled to the latest version of SL!

## How to use
Download it from [the releases](https://github.com/KadeDev/ExiledPatcher/releases/latest)

Then extract the zip into a folder, and take the latest Assembly-CSharp (Found in the managed folder in your SL Dedicated Server).

Then Drag'n'drop it onto the exe, it should output a new dll which is the latest version of exiled! (Assembly-CSharp, not the Exiled Events, etc)

## How to build the source?
To build the project you must take both folders an add them into a solution. I had them on seperate IDE's, which kinda fucked me over in the long run. So sorry about that.

No SLN's :(
